        <p>I have <em>some</em> experiences (maybe around 2years?) in "teaching" (or sharing things I know). 
        Things I love to share are tentatively related along the lines of programming, AI, mathematics (and life and philosophy I guess).
        So, you can call me a learner, teacher, preacher, knowledge sharing entity, mentor. Or an existence observing the universe. 
        Whatever it is, learning is a never-ending journey.
        </p>
        <p>These slides are used for teaching AI for <a href="http://jec.edu.np/">JEC</a> from May-July 2019.<p>
        <h4>The slides are according to chapters they cover.</h4>
        <p>There aren't any slides for few chapters since I taught them using whiteboard and other <em>better</em> references.<p>
        <p>These aren't the <b>BEST</b> resources you can find in the internet, but are meant to be taken as abstract concepts for the course.</p>
