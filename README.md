## A Placeholder for Intro? Yeah!

I have some experiences (maybe around 2years?) in "teaching" (or sharing things I know). Things I love to share are tentatively related along the lines of programming, AI, mathematics (and life and philosophy I guess). So, you can call me a learner, teacher, preacher, knowledge sharing entity, mentor. Or an existence observing the universe. Whatever it is, learning is a never-ending journey.  

These slides are used for teaching AI for JEC from May-July 2019.  

The slides are according to chapters they cover.  

**There aren't any slides for few chapters since I taught them using whiteboard and other better references.**  

These aren't the BEST resources you can find in the internet, but are meant to be taken as abstract concepts for the course.

Cheers. Enjoy. Keep on learning. Keep on sharing.
